I am recent data science fellow from Metis, a data science boot camp.
Previously I was a software engineer at Comcast and a Masters student in Computer Science from RIT.

Learning is my drug. There are so many things I am excited to learn and share my trials and triumps.

If there is something you feel that I know and would love to discus with me.

Currently I am in the job market actively looking for a new opportunity to learn and help a company learn with their data.
